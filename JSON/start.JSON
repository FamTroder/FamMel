    "This game is a date simulation with a desperation twist.",
    "Your goal is to get your date in bed with a full bladder, before the night is over.",
    "On your way there, convince your date to hold her pee, pee in a glass, squat outside, or even take you into the restroom with her.  Just don't make her wet her panties...",
    "Attraction points are your key to success.  They indicate how much she's into you, and therefore what she will do for you.",
    "Shyness points control how shy she acts around you.",
    "The bladder meter shows how much she's holding ... and she has definite physical limits in this department.",
    "What's in her tummy slowly flows to her bladder as time passes... with realistic modeling.",
    "There are many useful objects you can get in the game.  Don't blow all your cash in one place."
